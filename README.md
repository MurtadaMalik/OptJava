Homeworks from the Solving Optimization Problems Using Evolutionary Computation Algorithms in Java course.

## Homework 1 - Iterative Algorithms
Solving the Tri SAT problem by using 3 different approaches:

* Checking all the solutions
* Greedy iterative algorithm that tries to change the solution in just one bit. After trying out all the changes, the algorithm will continue with one of the solutions that were better than the previous one.
* Greedy iterative algorithm that changes one bit, but uses a fitness function that will generate the fitness bases on how many times a clause is true. This will result in giving the clauses that are true almost all the time a lower priority.

## Homework 2 - Numeric Optimization
Minimizing and maximizing different functions using:

* Gradient descent
* Newton's method

## Homework 3 - Simulated Annealing
Minimizing a function using simulated annealing with various solution representations and temperature schedules.

## Homework 4 - Genetic Algorithms
* Minimizing a function using an elitist genetic algorithm.
* Solving the "Box Packing Problem" using a steady-state genetic algorithm.

## Homework 5 - Genetic Algorithms
* Maximizing a function that has a large contant area using RAPGA (Relevant Alleles Preserving Genetic Algorithm). Tested different parameters and selection methods for the algorithm.
* Solving the quadratic assignment problem using SASEGASA (Self Adaptive Segregative Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing aspects).

## Homework 6 - Ant Algorithms
Solving the travelling salesman problem using Max-Min Ant System Algorithm.
